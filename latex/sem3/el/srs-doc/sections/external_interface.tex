\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

1. \textbf{User Interface}
The user interface (UI) of the health monitoring system is designed to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience for patients, healthcare providers, and administrators.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform Compatibility}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The app is initially developed using Next.js for web platform
        \item As part of future upgrades, the app will be expanded to support mobile devices
        \item Additionally, a desktop version of the app is planned for future development, offering users the ability to manage health records from their computers
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Design}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The design will follow Material Design guidelines, ensuring a modern and cohesive look across all screens
        \item The layout will be responsive and optimized for mobile screens, making navigation between features easy and efficient
        \item The app will feature a dashboard that provides quick access to health metrics, sensor readings, and reminders
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{User Roles and Access}:
    Depending on the user's role (patient, healthcare provider, or administrator), the interface will show different levels of access:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Patients will have access to their personal health data, reports, and sensor readings
        \item Healthcare providers will have options for viewing patient data and providing medical insights
        \item Administrators will have view-only access to system statistics and user management
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

2. \textbf{Hardware Interface}
