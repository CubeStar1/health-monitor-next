\section{Introduction}

HealthHub is a comprehensive health data management and AI-assisted analysis platform designed to address the growing complexity of personal health information management. This project implements a user-centered design approach, combining real-time sensor data integration, health records management, and AI-powered analysis to create a unified health monitoring solution.

The platform features a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline for intelligent data processing, real-time sensor monitoring, and personalized health insights delivery. The system integrates various data sources including Arduino sensors, medical records, and nutrition logs, while employing advanced technologies such as LangChain, OpenAI's GPT models, and vector databases.

This report details the complete development process, from initial problem identification through implementation and testing, highlighting how user needs informed each development decision and the technical solutions employed to meet these needs.
