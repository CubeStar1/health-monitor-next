This paper presents HealthHub, an AI-powered personal health assistant designed to help individuals make informed daily dietary choices by providing personalized food safety and nutritional insights. Users can log food intake, which HealthHub analyzes using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to query diverse sources like FSSAI advisories and food databases, and an SQL agent for nutritional pattern analysis. The system uniquely integrates personal health sensor data (e.g., heart rate) to correlate diet with physiological responses, offering potential risk warnings. HealthHub features an intuitive voice and video-enabled interface, aiming to empower users with accessible, actionable information for enhanced food safety awareness and personal well-being. Performance evaluations highlight the system's capability in processing user queries effectively and integrating multimodal data for comprehensive dietary support.
