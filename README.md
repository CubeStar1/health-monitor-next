- Document vectorization with Cohere embeddings for semantic search
- Health reports generation combining structured sensor data and unstructured medical records

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL with pgvector extension)
- AI/ML: Langchain, OpenAI API, Cohere embeddings
- External APIs: Tavily for medical web search

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Python (v3.8 or later)
- Supabase account
- OpenAI API key
- Gemini API key
- Tavily API key
- Cohere API key
- Resend API key
- Nutritionix API key

### Installation

1. Clone the frontend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CubeStar1/health-monitor-next.git
   cd health-monitor-next
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Clone the Python backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CubeStar1/health-monitor-api.git
   cd healthhub-backend
   ```

4. Set up the Python backend:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the frontend root directory and a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following contents:

   ```bash
   # Frontend .env (in health-monitor-next directory)

   # Supabase
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABAE_ADMIN=your_supabase_service_role_key

   # FastAPI
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   API_URL=http://localhost:8000

   # Resend
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
   RESEND_DOMAIN=your_resend_domain

   # Nutritionix API
   NUTRITIONIX_API_URL=https://trackapi.nutritionix.com/v2
   NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID=your_nutritionix_app_id
   NUTRITIONIX_API_KEY=your_nutritionix_api_key

   # DB Credentials
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_USER=<your_db_user>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_HOST=<your_db_host>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_PORT=<your_db_port>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_NAME=<your_db_name>
   ```

   ```bash
   # Backend .env (in health-monitor-api directory)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
   LOCAL_LLM_URL=<your_local_llm_url>
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
   COHERE_API_KEY=<your_cohere_api_key>
   TAVILY_API_KEY=<your_tavily_api_key>

   SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_project_url>
   SUPABASE_KEY=<your_supabase_service_role_key>

   ```


6. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # In the frontend directory
   cd health-monitor-next
   npm run dev

   # In a new terminal, navigate to the backend directory
   cd path/to/health-monitor-api
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```


## Medical Records Processing

When a medical record is uploaded:

1. The file is sent to the backend for processing.
2. If it's a PDF, it's converted to text using PyPDF2. If it's an image, OCR is performed using Tesseract.
3. The extracted text is then sent to Cohere to generate embeddings.
4. The embeddings, along with the original text and metadata, are stored in the Supabase vector database.

This process allows for efficient semantic search and retrieval of relevant information during chat interactions
