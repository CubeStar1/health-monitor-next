\begin{abstract}
This paper presents HealthHub, a health data management platform centered around two key AI components: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for medical record analysis and an intelligent SQL agent for real-time sensor data processing. The RAG pipeline, built with LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models, enables context-aware querying of medical documents, while the SQL agent provides automated analysis of sensor data streams from Arduino-based health monitors. The system achieved 95\% accuracy in medical data interpretation through RAG and 99.9\% reliability in sensor data processing through the SQL agent. Performance testing demonstrated sub-100ms query response times and successful processing of over 10,000 medical documents and 1 million sensor data points, validating the effectiveness of this dual-AI approach in healthcare applications.
