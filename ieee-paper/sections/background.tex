\section{Background}

\subsection{Retrieval-Augmented Generation}
RAG combines information retrieval with language model generation to provide context-aware responses [9]. In healthcare applications, RAG addresses several key challenges [1]:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Context Preservation:} Ensures responses are grounded in relevant medical documentation
\item \textbf{Accuracy:} Reduces hallucination by providing source material
\item \textbf{Verifiability:} Enables tracking of information sources
\item \textbf{Customization:} Allows adaptation to specific medical contexts
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SQL Agents in Healthcare}
SQL agents provide natural language interfaces to structured databases [14]. Their application in healthcare offers several advantages [4]:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Accessibility:} Enables natural language queries of sensor data
\item \textbf{Real-time Analysis:} Facilitates immediate access to sensor readings
\item \textbf{Data Integration:} Connects multiple sensor data sources
\item \textbf{Automated Insights:} Generates human-readable interpretations of sensor data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vector Databases in Healthcare}
Vector databases play a crucial role in modern healthcare systems [2]:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Semantic Search:} Enables meaning-based document retrieval
\item \textbf{Similarity Matching:} Identifies related medical records
\item \textbf{Efficient Retrieval:} Provides fast access to relevant information
\item \textbf{Scalability:} Handles large volumes of medical documents
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Related Work}
Previous research in healthcare data management has explored various approaches [5, 6]:

\begin{itemize}
\item Traditional document retrieval systems lacking context awareness
\item Natural language interfaces with limited integration capabilities
\item Sensor data management systems without AI-powered querying
\item Standalone RAG implementations without sensor data integration
\end{itemize}

HealthHub builds upon these foundations while addressing their limitations through the novel integration of RAG and SQL agent technologies [11].
